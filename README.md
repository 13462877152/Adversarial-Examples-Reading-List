# Adversarial-Examples-Reading-List
This is the reading list mainly on adversarial examples (attacks, defenses, etc.) I try to keep and update regularly.  
There are many publications in this area coming out almost every week so I want to keep track of them here, in case it will be useful to anyone who is also interested.

## Background
- 

## Attacks
- O. Poursaeed, I. Katsman, B. Gao, and S. Belongie, “Generative Adversarial Perturbations.”

## Defenses

## Robustness Analysis
- O. Bastani, Y. Ioannou, L. Lampropoulos, D. Vytiniotis, A. V Nori, and A. Criminisi, “Measuring Neural Net Robustness with Constraints.”
- A. Fawzi, O. Fawzi, and P. Frossard, “Analysis of classifiers’ robustness to adversarial perturbations.”

## Applications


## To-Read
- W. Brendel, J. Rauber, and M. Bethge, “DECISION-BASED ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS: RELIABLE ATTACKS AGAINST BLACK-BOX MACHINE LEARNING MODELS,” 2017.
- A. Bagnall, R. Bunescu, and G. Stewart, “Training Ensembles to Detect Adversarial Examples,” 2017.
